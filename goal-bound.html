                        <div class="bottom-bar"></div>
                        <p>GoalBound (formerly "10 Letters") is a web application designed to help CSUN's baseball
                            team
                            optimize their performance
                            through weekly goal-setting.</p>

                        <p>CSUN Baseball Team's Coach, Gregory Moore, developed a method to promote strength and
                            versatility
                            by modeling and
                            committing to goals and improving skills daily and weekly.</p>

                        <p>GoalBound is a digitized version of Gregory Moore's method, which allows individuals to
                            build
                            self-control, analyze
                            their goals, and improve via cohesive goal-setting and evaluation.</p>

                        <p>The evaluation is done through self-assessment based on an honor system, which reinforces
                            personal accountability.</p>
                        <h2 class="heading text-3xl mt-5 mb-3">My Role</h2>
                        <div class="bottom-bar"></div>
                        <p>My role in this project was to research, design, and test user interfaces related to the
                            project.
                            I was a mentor and the lead UX designer on an Agile team comprised of five student
                            developers, a designer, a product
                            owner, a scrum master, and four other staff mentors.</p>

                        <p>The Goalbound application was already heavily under development when Coach Gregory Moore
                            shared details of how he
                            would like the ability to assign mentors to mentees. Since we were working in an Agile
                            scrum
                            environment, I had to be
                            responsive to changing requirements while working with what was already built.</p>
                        <p>I learned the
                            requirements from our
                            product owner and collaborated with the lead front-end developer to come up with a good
                            user
                            experience workflow. Since
                            this was my first main UX task on this project, I was eager to get started.</p>

                        <p>
                            Before I could make any progress with this application, I took time to familiarize
                            myself with all the documentation on
                            file, including the client proposal and the paper version of Coach Greg Moore’s
                            goal-setting methodology.

                        <p>
                            I discovered that the coach view within the application lacked a clear user flow. Our
                            goal became to rethink the way the
                            coach interacted with and assigned roles within his team.
                        </p>
                        <p>The sticky notes allowed my colleague and me to mentally run through each user flow to
                            easily identify missing details
                            and roadblocks and iterate solutions.</p>
                        <p>We created user stories based on the list of task items and then created several
                            whiteboard wireframes of what each
                            component might look like. Drawing rough wireframe sketches helped us think and talk
                            through each possible flow and
                            served as a springboard to communicate and visualize our proposed solutions.</p>
                        <p>This wireframe would eventually serve as a user testing tool.</p>

                        <p>I created wireframe screens in Adobe XD to ensure that the task flow was present for each
                            user story.</p>
                        <p>After building the initial wireframe, I turned each screen into a clickable prototype.
                        </p>
                        <p>As I wireframe, I organize and clearly label where each user flow starts. Organizing in
                            this way makes it easier to
                            understand the context of each flow when collaborating with other teammates and
                            presenting to clients.</p>

                            managing his team roster and
                            tested out the prototype with each other before bringing in external users (students who
                            have never seen or used the

                        <p>We were finally ready to collect real user feedback with a series of in-person user tests at
                            this phase. I asked users
                            to perform each task while thinking aloud so that we could get a good idea of what sections
                            were confusing or pleasant
                            to use.</p>
                        <p>I took note of any moments I saw the user hesitate with their cursor. Part of observing a
                            user test is looking for
                            patterns in behavior, so when multiple users got stuck in the same spot, it was a clear sign
                            that something in the user
                            experience needed modification.</p>
                        <p>My colleague and I alternated administering the test while the other would be taking notes
                            and filming. Being mentors,
                            we felt it was important to record our user tests to review anything we may have missed and
                            educate the UI/UX students
                            on how a user test is run.</p>

                        <p>As with any user test, we collected feedback and modified our wireframes accordingly.</p>
                        <p>We began the second round of user tests with the modifications that resulted in a much more
                            “intuitive” user flow.</p>
                        <p>After this second round of testing, we made small modifications to our wireframe again and
                            then passed on the wireframes
                            to the development student teams to start building and the design student to begin working
                            on a high fidelity mockup.</p>
                        <p>Because our team worked in Agile sprints and I wanted to accommodate enough time for our
                            design student to work, we
                            compromised by having the development team build the application based on wireframes
                            initially and styling would be
                            applied afterward.</p>

                            create a high-fidelity mockup. Here I allowed our design student to work on the mockup while
                            I helped give feedback and
                            guidance.</p>

                        <p>We demonstrated the UI mockup to our client, Coach Moore. He was pleased with our work and
                            approved of the flow and
                            design. After gaining approval, we passed off the high-fidelity mockups to the front-end
                            development team.</p>
                        <p>With the latest update, the coach was able to manage his team as well as assign peer mentors.
                            The end result was a clear
                            UI that helped encompass multiple use cases.</p>

                        <p>I joined the team after Goalbound had already started and begun development. Ideally, user
                            experience design would
                            precede development, but I saw the situation as a growth opportunity. I know that I won't
                            always have the luxury of
                            joining a project from the very beginning.</p>
                        <h3 class="heading text-2xl capitalize">Limited access to the user</h3>
                        <p>A challenge for this project was having limited access to testing with Coach Moore. He had a
                            very busy schedule and was
                            notorious for missing client demos. Knowing this, we had to improvise user testing.</p>
                        <p>One way we handled this challenge was to do in-house testing. The students tested the user
                            flow described in this case
                            study. I also had students test other parts of the application where the baseball team was
                            expected to set goals within
                            the application.</p>
                        <p>Although our student developers were not part of a baseball team, they were still close
                            enough to the target user
                            demographic that in-house testing was better than none at all.</p>

                        <p>Because of this project, I realized how important it is to collaborate during the ideation
                            stage. When I first started
                            designing, I felt like I needed to work privately and show others my work when it was
                            complete. After working on this
                            project, I learned that the best ideas can and often do come from collaborating with your
                            colleagues. Additionally,
                            getting the feedback and opinion of others, whether they be colleagues, users, or even
                            friends, ultimately helps build a
                            stronger product.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to see the finished result of this web application because the
                            department I was working in
                            dissolved before the baseball team was able to use the product. Even if our student team was
                            able to complete this
                            application, our client left the baseball team about a month after the department disbanded.
                            I'm still grateful for the
                            learning opportunity this project offered our team.</p>
